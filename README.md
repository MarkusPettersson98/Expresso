This is the GitHub-page for Group Togepi in the course  "DAT256 / DIT543 Software engineering project" held at Chalmers University of Technology.

## About
During the course we developed a React Native application in which you can order coffee from selected caf√©s around campus. The purpose of the project was to facilitate the process of ordering coffee as well as contributing to improved sustainability by reducing the amount of disposable cups.

## The app
### Selecting and paying for a Coffee
The most expected use-case. A user navigates to their favourite coffee-shop and selects a coffee and pays for it using their student-id.

### Scanning recieved QR-code
After recieving a QR-code it is possible to validate the reciept using our backend hosted at heroku. The cellphone scanning the QR-code would be substituted by a machine or a barista.
